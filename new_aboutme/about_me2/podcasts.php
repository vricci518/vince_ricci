					In October of 2020 I made the decision, along with my friend Justin, to enter the world of YouTube Podcasting. We were both fans of numerous Knitting Related Podcasts, following and watching them on a regular basis. As we are both avid knitters we were sure that we could do this, a comment we both made after watching the latest episode of our favorite podcasts. After several months of having that same discussion we made the leap and <em>Boozie Bears Knitting Podcast</em> was born!<br />

				<p>
					We follow a common episode format of discussing Works In Progress (WIPs), Finished Objects (FO's), as well as Purchases and Aquisitions.
